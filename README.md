Some small apps just for fun.

## Puzzle Game

Choose or upload an image, it will be split into tiles and shuffled for the user to unshuffle.

### How it works

The image is split into tiles based on the selected difficulty.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>7</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Each tile renders the same image but only the portion of the image it's responsible for.

The position of the tiles can then be swapped to shuffle the image and for the user to unshuffle.

The puzzle is solved when all tiles are back in their original position.
